## Task X
Your next task is to create a maze-solving algorithm. The maze in which the robots will be tested is *simply connected*, which means that all its walls will be connected together. In order to traverse the maze, the robot will be traveling along the line, so you will need to expand on the line follower program you created in the previous step.
