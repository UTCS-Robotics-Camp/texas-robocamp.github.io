## Task X
Your next task is to create a maze-solving algorithm. The maze in which the robots will be tested is *simply connected*, which means that all its walls will be connected together. In order to traverse the maze, the robot will be traveling along the line, so you will need to expand on the line follower program you created in the previous step. 

The maze will have both T-intesections and four way intersections. In these cases, which way should the robot go first? Try to make the robot turn in the same direction, whichever you choose, every time it is faced with this choice. The end of the maze will be marked by a black rectangle, at which point the robot must stop.
