## Task X

The default behavior of the obstacle avoidance program is to turn away when the robot senses obstacles on one side, or back up when the robot senses obstacles on both sides. This is bad driving! The robot should tell us when it's about to turn or back up. The objective of your first robot program is signalling.

We will let you decide how to signal. We suggest a beep for backing up, and lights for turning.
