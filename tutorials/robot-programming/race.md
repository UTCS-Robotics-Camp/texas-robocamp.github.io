Now we're going to race our robot against each other.

## Challenge 8: Race!

- Add an entry to your user interface to allow you to start the robot with a button press.
- Modify your line follower program to allow the robot to complete the race course on the bridge as fast as possible.
- Line your robot up at the marks on the race course.
- Have a counselor time your robot.
- The winner wins the race, and nothing more. This is just for fun.
