It's customary in the world of computer science that whenever you learn a new programming language, you always begin by writing a program to display the text Hello World to the screen. In programming, displaying text is referred to as "printing," so we're going to learn how to print "Hello World".

## Main

Whenever we begin a C++ program, we begin by writing a function called `main`. A function is a group of instructions about how to do some common task. The `main` function is the first function that executes when we run our C++ program, and it often uses other functions inside it. Using the cereal example above, imagine that we had a function called getMilk that contained instructions for how to get and open the milk from the fridge. Let's say we had functions for each part of the algorithm above. In our main function, we would "call", or ask the computer to run, each of those functions in the order that we wanted them to occur.

Sometimes, functions are already written for us and are stored in libraries. Using these functions saves us time and makes programming easier. For example, in C++ , you could write lines and lines of code to make the computer print a message to the screen. Or, you could use the `iostream` library that already has a function called `cout`, which is much simpler!

Ok, we're ready to write our first program! Following the instructions for compiling and running via the command line (we suggest you open this page in a new tab and leave it open for reference), copy the following program, save it, and run it. Then read on for a description of what each part of the program does. Note that the first two lines are very important, so you should copy them, too!

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
     cout << "Hello World!\n";
}
```

Now we'll take a look at the code line-by-line. First, we tell the computer to include all the functions included in the `iostream` library when it compiles the program, so that we get to use cout. We always enclose library names in angle brackets. The next line, `using namespace std`; tells the compiler that library functions we use (like `cout`) are the ones included in the `std` namespace. For the most part, you just want to include that line in your code and not worry about why until some later class.

Next, we define our main function by saying `int main()`. This tells the computer that there is a function called `main` that returns an integer (more on this later). We then put an open curly brace to begin the code that is part of the main function.

We only have one command for this program. We tell the computer to use the `cout` function and then put what we want to print after <<. You can think of the double left-angle brackets as an arrow pointing toward cout, meaning that we are sending something (in this case, `"Hello World\n"`) to `cout`. We put quotation marks around the words we want to display (this is called a string), and end the string with `"\n"`. This is a special character that tells the computer to go to the next line, kind of like hitting Enter at the end of a line when you are typing. In C++, every code line (ones without braces) ends in a semi-colon. So, we are telling the computer to send our string to cout to be displayed on the screen. We then use a closing brace to end the function, and with it, the program.

## Compiling and Executing from the Command Line

As previously mentioned the Programming in Linux guide, you will be writing your program in C++ using sublime, a simple text editor for Linux. If you have not already opened sublime, do so now. Then for each program you write for the tutorial, follow these instructions:

1. Copy the Hello World program above, and paste it into a new file in the editor.

2. Save your file. Go to File > Save As... If this is your first tutorial save, create a new folder somewhere within your home directory structure. Click the Create Folder button, and name it something exciting and descriptive, like Tutorial. If you choose, you may further organize your individual tutorial programs into their own directoriesâ€”we leave it up to you. Give your file a descriptive name with a file type of .cpp. For example, for your first program, you might name the file HelloWorld.cpp. Among other things, the .cpp will tell sublime that the content of this file is C++ code, and it will give you useful editing features accordingly. Add your code.

3. Compile your code. Compiling is converting it from the (basically) English version you typed into the language understood by the machine (which is all 0s and 1s). The output of a successful compilation will be an executable file. This is what you will use to run, or execute, your program. To compile, do the following: Make sure your files are saved! Bring up your terminal window. Navigate to the directory where you saved your file using the commands we talked about here under Linux Commands. Once you're in the same directory as your file, begin typing in the following: `g++ -o`

   Replace with the name of the file you have been editing, and replace with something similarly descriptive. For example, for your HelloWorld program, you might compile with the following: `g++ HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld`

   Check the output in the terminal to see if the build was a success. If it was not, one or more errors will be printed to the terminal. See if you can understand and then fix the given errors. If you can't, please ask us! Compiler errors can be cryptic.

4. Run your program. Here's where the executable comes in! Still in your terminal, in the same directory as your program files, type in the following: `./executableName`

   Replace `executableName` with the name you gave your executable when you compiled. Using the above example, to run your HelloWorld program you would enter ./HelloWorld at the command line.

   Hit Enter to run the command. Output from the execution will be printed to the terminal.

{% include note.html content="Many things can go wrong when you are programming, so please ask for help before you get frustrated! (Just turn your cups to red!)" %}"

## Task 1:

Modify the Hello World program so that it prints, "Hello World and Your Name". For example, if your name is Justine, it would display, Hello World and Justine. Next, add a second line of text.

{% include callout_red_cup.html task="X" %}

Yay! You have written your first C++ program!
