This tutorial will prepare you to program in C++, which we will use with your robot.

Tutorial topics are listed in the sidebar. As you complete tutorials, camp counselors will track your progress. Don't forget to switch off when pair programming and keep track of who's driving!

After this tutorial, you will program your robot.

## Overview


{% include note.html content="Some of you may be experienced programmers. If you are already well-versed in programming, please complete the tutorials anyway. You should be able to do them quickly. For those of you who are new, please do not worry. Programming is a skill that takes time to develop, but we know that you will be able to get through this material and program your robot!" %}


C++ is a programming language. It can be used to write programs like web browers, games, or the programs controlling your robot. Like a spoken language, a programming language has a vocabulary and grammar rules. A C++ program can be thought of as a list of instructions, in order, for the computer to carry out.


To program, begin by thinking very carefully about the computer should do, and create a step-by-step plan for how the computer will do it. This is called an algorithm. For example, an algorithm for making a bowl of cereal might look like the following:

- Take out a bowl from the cabinet and place it on the counter
- Take out a box of cereal from the cabinet and open it
- Pour the cereal from the box into the bowl until it almost reaches the top of the bowl
- Close the box and put it back in the cabinet
- Open the fridge and take out the milk
- Open the milk and pour it into the bowl until the cereal reaches the top of the bowl
- Close the milk and put it back in the fridge
- Take a spoon from the silverware drawer and put it in the bowl

Notice how detailed that algorithm is! When you write an algorithm, you want to be as detailed and specific as possible, because computers only do what they are specifically instructed to do. They only know as much as you tell them, so if you want to the computer to do something correctly, you'd better tell it exactly how and give it enough information to complete the task.

We'll come back to the idea of an algorithm in just a moment, but first let's write our first C++ program.
