Texas RoboCamp welcomes campers with multiple levels of experience. As a result, some of you are probably ahead of the group. That's okay! We invite you to try challenging interesting stuff with your robot.

## LEDS and FastLED

We've purchased enough LEDs for each team to attach up to 14 LEDs to their robot. These LEDs are WS2812B full-color RGB LED modules mounted on a self-adhesive flexible PCB strip. They can be cut apart and stuck to any part of your robot, though we have a suggested project or two. You can incorporate these LEDs into your other tutorials, adding a bit of flair to the way you do things. If this seems like what you want to do, proceed to ["Using LEDs"](led.html)
