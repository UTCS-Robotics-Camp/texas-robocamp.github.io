## Welcome to Texas RoboCamp!

First, welcome to camp! If you are seated at your workstation then hopefully:

* You have already met your partner for the camp.
* You have completed, or are well on the way to completing the assembly of your Bot'n'Roll One!

This week you will go through a partially self-paced tutorial on how to program your robot. Your tutorial will be interspersed with instruction, activities on the robot, and outside activities like visits to tech companies and lectures from scientists working in robotics. We have done everything that we could think of to pack as much fun as possible into this week.

First, a few preliminaries.

## Cups

You have received a pair of cups which are taped to each other. One is red. One is blue. At this time, you should place you pair of cups on top of the computer monitor in front of you, with the blue cup facing up.

* When the red cup is facing upward, it means:

   * I need help.
 
   * I have completed an exercise or tutorial, and am ready for camp staff to mark my progress.

* When the blue cup is facing upward, it means:

  * Neither of those two conditions are currently true.

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a technique by which two people work together to solve a programming problem. In this camp, you and your partner will work together to program your robot. You will keep each other on task and motivated. You will talk through coding issues when you do not know how to solve them.

You should spend roughly equal time "driving," typing at the computer. To help you keep track, we have given you a pair programming log.

Fill it out as follows:

* Put your team number next to the text "Team Number."

* Put your log number in the "log number" box. This is there in case you fill up more than one sheet.

  * C++, as well as most programming languages begins indexing at Zero. So, your first log should be 0 in order to remind you of this, not 1!

* Put the person on the top of your team sheet as Camper 0, and the one at the bottom as Camper 1. These numbers do not indicate rank or seniority, nor do they indicate that either of you is a zero or number one. They track your hours.

* When beginning to work on an exercise or tutorial, or any time that you are solving a programming problem, elect a "driver" who will be operating the computer. Write their number into the next line under "Driver," and mark the current date, and start time.

* When switching drivers, mark the "Stop" time. Compute the amount of time that has elapsed and put that into the corresponding box under the number of the current driver. Then, fill out the next line appropriately for the new driver.

* When you reach the Subtotal boxes, add up the amount of time that each of you has spent driving.

* Try to change drivers every 30 minutes.

## Keeping Track of your Robot

Everyone in this camp has a virtually identical robot.

In order to tell them apart, when they could become mixed up, write your team number on a sticky note and stick it to the top of the robot.

## Tutorials

Everyone will work and learn at a different pace. To accomodate this, this camp comprises a series of partially self-paced tutorials. Each of these tutorials is documented on this website. You can easily navigate the tutorials using the navigation bar on the left. You can always return to the top of the website by clicking on the "Texas RoboCamp" logo in the upper left-hand corner.

## Activities

Groups of tutorials add up to activities. Once you have learned enough skills to perform an activity, you will implement a programming challege to make your robot do a new thing. If you complete all of the tutorials and activities, there are "customized activities" at the end of the camp, which invite you to become creative in the way that you use what you have learned or improve the performance of something that you have written to try to improve the performance of your robot.

## Tracking your Progress

At designated points through your progress on this website, you will be asked to notify camp staff of your progress.

It will look like this:

{% include cup-callout.html task=Example %}

At this point, please **actually** flip your cup to red in order to indicate that you have reached this point in the tutorial.
