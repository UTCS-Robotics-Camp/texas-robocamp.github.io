First, welcome to camp! If you are seated at your workstation then hopefully:

* You have already met your partner for the camp.
* You have completed, or are well on the way to completing the assembly of your Bot'n'Roll One!

This week you will go through a mostly self-paced tutorial on how to program your robot. Your tutorial will be interspersed with instruction, challenges and activities on the robot, and outside activities like visits to tech companies and lectures from scientists working in robotics. We have done everything that we could think of to pack as much fun as possible into this week.

First, a few preliminaries.

## Cups

You have received a pair of cups which are taped to each other. One is red. One is blue. At this time, you should place your pair of cups on top of the computer monitor in front of you, with the blue cup facing up.

* When the red cup is facing upward, it means:

   * I need help.
 
   * I have completed something, and am ready for camp staff to mark my progress.

* When the blue cup is facing upward, it means:

  * Neither of those two conditions are currently true.

{% include callout_blue_cup.html task="Initial Setup" comment="If you need help, you will indicate such by flipping it to red from now on. Once you have completed this, keep going through the tutorial." %}


At this point, please **actually** flip your cup to blue, and start using the cups as needed. 

## Synchronizing Groups

There are some activities that we will do as one big group. For instance, sections of the tutorial are accompanied by brief lectures or group activities. Sections that are done as a group will be marked with a yellow box to indicate that you should wait to synchronize with the other campers.

{% include callout_synchronize.html  comment="Just kidding. Keep going." %}

Seriously, that yellow box is just there to show you what it looks like.

## Tips

Sometimes we need to tell you something tangential to the line of thought of the tutorial, but important to point out, or to highlight something so you do not forget to do it. We'll mark these boxes green.

{% include tip.html content="Don't get distracted by the tips. They're intended to help you, not side-track you." %}

## Command Line Instructions

Sometimes we just want you to type something into the computer so we can get on to the next thing. In-depth instruction on that command would slow down the camp, so we just tell you what to do. You can literally copy-paste the commands, minus the bullets.

cd
ls
pwd

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a technique by which two people work together to solve a programming problem. In this camp, you and your partner will work together to program your robot. You will keep each other on task and motivated. You will talk through coding issues when you do not know how to solve them.

You should spend roughly equal time "driving," typing at the computer. To help you keep track, we have given you a pair programming log.

![Programming log](images/programming_log.png)

Fill it out as follows:

* Put your team number next to the text "Team Number."

* Put your log number in the "log number" box. This is there in case you fill up more than one sheet.

  * C++, as well as most programming languages begins indexing at Zero. So, your first log should be 0 in order to remind you of this, not 1!

* Put the person on the top of your team sheet as Camper 0, and the one at the bottom as Camper 1.

  * These numbers do not indicate rank or seniority, nor do they indicate that either of you is a zero or number one. They track your hours.

* When beginning to work on an exercise or tutorial, or any time that you are solving a programming problem, elect a "driver" who will be operating the computer. Write their number into the next line under "Driver," and mark the current date, and start time.

* When switching drivers, mark the "stop" time. Compute the amount of time that has elapsed and put that into the corresponding box under the number of the current driver. Then, fill out the next line appropriately for the new driver.

* When you reach the Subtotal boxes, add up the amount of time that each of you has spent driving.

* Try to change drivers every 30 minutes.

## Keeping Track of your Robot

Everyone in this camp has a virtually identical robot. To tell them apart, we will give you sticky notes.

In the next few minutes, you will write you team number onto the sticky note and stick it to the top of your robot. Don't worry about this at this time.

## Tutorials

Everyone will work and learn at a different pace. To accomodate this, this camp comprises a series of mostly self-paced tutorials. Each of these tutorials is documented on this website. You can easily navigate the tutorials using the navigation bar on the left. You can always return to the top of the website by clicking on the "Texas RoboCamp" logo in the upper left-hand corner.

## Challenges and Activities

Tutorials prepare you for programming challenges and activities by providing you with the tools that you need in order to complete the task.

Once you have learned enough skills to solve a programming challenge or take part in an activity, the tutorial will present you with an activity or challenge to participate in.

Because the week is self-paced, feel free to take longer on activities and challenges that you really enjoy. Be wary that some later activities and challenges build on skills that you develop in earlier ones, so make sure that you *do* complete each activity.

There are "customized activities" at the end of the camp, which invite you to become creative in the way that you use what you have learned or improve the performance of something that you have written to try to improve the performance of your robot.

## Tracking your Progress

At designated points through your progress on this website, you will be asked to notify camp staff of your progress.

Your progress will be logged in a progress log. You're about to see what your first progress log looks like.


{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands }}
HI
{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands_end }}

{{ site.data.alerts.tip }}
We don't want you printing things unless instructed to by the camp. Please refrain from printing things using `lpr` unless either instructed to do so or unless you have previously obtained permission from a counselor to do so.
{{ site.data.alerts.end }}

It will look like this:

{% include callout_red_cup.html task="[Tutorial 1]" %}

At this point, please **actually** flip your cup to red.
