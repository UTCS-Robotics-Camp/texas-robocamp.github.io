## Git

Git is a version control system. It allows multiple programmers to collaborate on long-term projects by synchronizing code across their machines. Explaining the details of this would ~~waste time~~ **TODO** *Since we're virtual it might be worth actually discussing git for time*, so we're just going to tell you what to type here.


{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands }}
cd
git clone https://github.com/texas-robocamp/exercises.git
{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands_end }}

{% include callout_red_cup.html task="[Exercise 2]" %}

**TODO** *We do need to change the callout but I wonder if there's a way to edit it so that if we don't change anything else, we could just put this page in the root dir and not need two copies of it*
