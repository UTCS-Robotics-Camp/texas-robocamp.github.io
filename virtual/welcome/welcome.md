First, welcome to camp! ~~You should be seated at a workstation next to your partner. If you have not yet taken the time to introduce yourselves to each other, spend a minute or two to get to know each other. You'll be working together all week.~~ 

**TODO** *We're gonna need a new intro*


This week you will go through a mostly self-paced tutorial on how to program your robot. Your tutorial will be interspersed with instruction, challenges and activities on the robot, and ~~outside activities like visits to tech companies and lectures from scientists working in robotics.~~ *are we doing any kind of outreach stuff?* We have done everything that we could think of to pack as much fun as possible into this week.

First, a few preliminaries.

## ~~Cups~~ **TODO** Some Way to Communicate You Need Help

{% include note.html content="None of the info in this paragraph is relevant in the virtual space, other than RED meaning help and BLUE being the default color." %}

- Explain the communication system

- Have them test the usage of the communication system to make sure it works

## Synchronizing Groups

There are some activities that we will do as one big group. For instance, sections of the tutorial are accompanied by brief lectures or group activities. Sections that are done as a group will be marked with a yellow box to indicate that you should wait to synchronize with the other campers.

{% include callout_synchronize.html  comment="This is just to show you what it looks like. Keep going." %}

> Are we still planning on global syncs? I imagine we'll still want to use this tool but we could probably use our interface to force syncs if we need them.

## Tips

Sometimes we need to tell you something tangential to the line of thought of the tutorial, but important to point out. Tips look like this.

{% include tip.html content="Don't get distracted by the tips. They're intended to help you, not side-track you." %}

## Command Line Instructions

Sometimes we just want you to type something into the computer and we just tell you what it is. You should literally copy-paste these commands when you see a box like this. The commands below are just an example, and are harmless, but not productive.

{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands }}
cd
ls
pwd
{{ site.data.alerts.terminal_commands_end }}

## Tutorials

This camp comprises a series of mostly self-paced tutorials. Each tutorial is documented on this website. You can navigate the tutorials using the navigation bar on the left. You can always return to the top of the website by clicking on the "Texas RoboCamp" logo in the upper left-hand corner.

## ~~Where You Sit~~ **TODO** Zoom Room Management

Every time you enter ~~the lab~~ zoom, your assigned ~~seat~~ room will change. This is so we can group campers together who are working on similar activities, so we can better help you as a group. ~~Please make sure to look for the sign indicating where you should sit every time you enter into the lab, and sit in the corresponding area.~~ *We're just automating this, right? So no need to explain it? I know we also discussed letting the campers pick rooms if they decide they want to stay with a counselor so we might want to mention that here*

## Challenges and Activities

Tutorials prepare you for programming challenges and activities by providing you with the tools that you need in order to complete the task.

Once you have learned enough skills to solve a programming challenge or take part in an activity, the tutorial will present you with an activity or challenge to participate in.

Because the week is self-paced, feel free to take longer on activities and challenges that you really enjoy. Be wary that some later activities and challenges build on skills that you develop in earlier ones, so make sure that you *do* complete each activity.

There are bonus activities at the end of the camp, which invite you to become creative in the way that you use what you have learned or improve the performance of something that you have written to try to improve the performance of your robot.

## Tracking your Progress

### Progress Logs

Your progress will be logged in a progress log. You're about to see what your first progress log looks like.

**TODO** *I think this part is still relevant in that we should introduce them to whatever progress interface we build. Physical version of these instructions is about printing paper - they won't be doing that this year.*

*There was a section here about pair programming - we're not doing that anymore*

### ~~Red Cups~~ Some Way to Mark Progress

At designated points through your progress on this website, you will be asked to notify camp staff of your progress.

It will look like this:

{% include callout_red_cup.html task="[Tutorial 1]" %}

> Are we still going to use this callout? If so, we may want to consider changing it so that it's not saying Red Cup

At this point, please ~~**actually** flip your cup to red.~~ mark your progress with the web interface.
