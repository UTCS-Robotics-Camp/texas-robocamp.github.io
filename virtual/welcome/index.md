*As an aside, having a table of contents here looks clunky since we only have one title. We should look into removing it if that's possible*

This site serves as your home base for reference material relating to the Texas RoboCamp and for the camp's tutorials and exercises.

If you are in the first, ~~Sunday~~ Monday session of Texas Robocamp, please procede to the "Welcome to Camp!" tutorial. (Found under "Welcome!/Welcome to Camp!") If you are returning, you should pick up where you left off. Clicking on the "Texas RoboCamp" logo at the top of the page will always bring you back here.


## Next Step

Proceed to ["Welcome to Camp!"](/welcome.html)

*We never explicitly tell the students to go to* ["Getting Started"](getting_started.html); *we may want to consider changing that here as well as for the physical camp*
