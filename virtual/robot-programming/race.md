Now we're going to race our robot against each other.

## Challenge 8: Race!

- Add an entry to your user interface to allow you to start the robot by pressing Button 1.
- Modify your line follower program to allow the robot to complete the race course on the bridge as fast as possible.
- The winner wins the race, and nothing more. This is just for fun!

When you finish the race, your time will be uploaded to the [leaderboard page](leaders.html). Be patient if it takes a second, as there might be some internet latency.
